      # Note: For self-hosted on ECS, we might mount volumes, but for production
      # we usually push to the HTTP API. This assumes API access.
      # If using self-hosted without external exposure, this might need
      # to run on a self-hosted runner or use a helper container.
      # For now, we will create a placeholder implementation confirming the interface.
