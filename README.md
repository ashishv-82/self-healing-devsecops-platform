# Self-Healing DevSecOps Platform
## Self-Healing Infrastructure & Security Governance on AWS ECS

---

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines an **Autonomous Self-Healing Infrastructure Platform** that uses AI agents to detect, diagnose, and remediate infrastructure failures in real-time. The system combines chaos engineering, observability, and LLM-powered reasoning to achieve zero-touch operations with full audit compliance.

## 1. Problem Statement

In high-compliance Fintech environments, manual incident response creates critical bottlenecks:

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Operational Fatigue** | SRE teams spend ~70% of time on repetitive firefighting and log analysis |
| **Configuration Drift** | Manual hotfixes bypass version control, violating SOC2/audit standards |
| **Security Latency** | Misconfigurations remain exposed for minutes/hours awaiting human triage |
